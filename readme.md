# ExpressApp1
This is a quick express app based on the first static webpage I made during the 100 days of code.


## Installation:
This is a node.js website that allows visitors to submit work inquiries that email directly to the owner. For now it just renders a test email and logs the associated url in the console. But, changing this to a real account would be trivial. Additionally, it sanitizes and validates the form fields to protect the site against various attacks such as XSS or injection.
